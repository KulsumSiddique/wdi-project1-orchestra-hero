# General Assembly WDI Project 1: Le HÃ©ros Orchestral

## Goal
To create a single-page web game, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies learnt in the first three weeks of the WDI course.

## Game Description
Play some of the most famous classical music masterpieces in the world's finest concert halls with the world-renowned Orchestre Philharmonique d'Amiens! Just make sure you meet their strict standards and do not enrage their notoriously fierce conductor, Monsieur Enmarche...

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 with HTML5 audio
* CSS3 with animation
* JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
* jQuery
* Git
* GitHub
* Google Fonts
* Photoshop
* Logic Pro with EastWest samples (for the audio)

## Approach Taken

### Initial Idea
Given that I have a degree in classical music, my favourite pieces of music are all orchestral. Unfortunately, few agree with me. Whilst there are many music games about featuring different popular music styles, classical music is underrepresented.

So I wanted to create a game that portrays orchestral music in a fun light, but I also wanted to be realistic about what it's like to play in an orchestra. So sometimes the user will be playing the melody, sometimes they will be playing in the background, and sometimes they will not be playing at all!

I envisaged this to be an educational game too, featuring info pop-ups about the composers, pieces, instruments and concert halls.
